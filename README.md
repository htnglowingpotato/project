# We wanted to learn Python and we are highly political (sorry if you are genuinely a Trump supporter). Why not learn by using the Pygame library to build a basic game, and do some sentiment analysis of his tweets to determine how bullshitty they are?
## What it does
You play a **basic brickbreaker game** with **Donald Trump's head** as the ball and a word of his **bullshittiest tweets** as the bricks!
## How I built it
-Pygame library for the brickbreaker game
-Twitter API to get the tweets
-Firebase API to store the tweets
-TextBlob and basic Naive Bayes Classifier for the sentiment analysis
## Challenges I ran into
-Downloading python packages sucks
-Libraries are outdated
-Sentiment analysis is highly complicated
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
-We were able to produce a game, use the Twitter API, do basic sentiment analysis, and use the Firebase API all using Python - not bad !
## What I learned
-Pygame library is not as cool as we thought, but still easy to use and a lot of documentation
-Sentiment analysis is highly nuanced
-We want to learn more about databases ...
## What's next for Bullshit Breaker
We want to take it to the next level - LITERALLY. Adding new levels, making the graphics sexier
